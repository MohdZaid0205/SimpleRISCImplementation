Hold My **Assembler** as it is a **modular**, **retargetable** assembler built to demystify the translation from mnemonic to machine code. Designed with a strict **3-Layer Architecture**, so that it completely decouples the parsing of assembly syntax from the generation of binary executables.

## **Installation** and **Usage**

**HMSAM** can only be installed through repository clone and compilation.
> Binaries and Installation procedure will be provided once `hmasm` development is complete.

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/MohdZaid0205/hmasm.git
```

### Install `build tools`

```cmd
winget install Kitware.CMake
winget install Ninja-build.Ninja
```

Verify build tools installation by.
```
cmake --version
ninja --version
```

if not installed properly please download installers from [cmake installation site](https://cmake.org/download/) and [ninja installation site](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) and redo verification steps.

### Build `HMASM`

To build project hmasm with options `INSTALL_IN_SYSTEM` to install it in `bin` directory of your system. Otherwise binaries are added to `"{SOURCE_DIR}/bin"`. 

```cmd
cmake --list-presets
cmake --preset <preset-name> -DINSTALL_IN_SYSTEM=ON
```

> you will be given a list of `presets` to choose from, select one of them, for development purpose any preset with `-debug` will be beneficial, for usage purpose use one containing `-release`.

> if you do not want installation to occur at system-level do not pass flag `-DINSTALL_IN_SYSTEM`

after project has been built, you can build executables and install them.

```cmd
cmake --build . --list-presets
cmake --build . --preset <build-preset-name> --clean-first --target install
```

> `Administrator` privileges maybe required if installation target was  `system`.

> In windows you may need to add installation target to `PATH` for direct usage. 

### Use `HMASM`

To use `HMASM` use binaries contained within `bin/`.

```cmd
hmasm-<fmt>-<isa> <flags> <file[s]>
...
```

> usage is incomplete until project is in usable state
